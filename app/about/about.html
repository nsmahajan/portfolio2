      <p>I am a software engineer based out of Boston, MA. I completed my Masters in Computer Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, learning a plethora of concepts like HCI, UI design, Android, Databases and Big Data Analytics.I have throughly enjoyed developing web and mobile applications in my experience.</p>
      <p>I am hard working, focused and one of my best strength is attention to detail. I love the journey of learning new technology, understanding the intracacies and then creating a solution that actually is used in the real world to acheive business goals. I still get statisfaction looking at the the web UI games that I developed during my early career, being hosted on websites like BBC, Facebook etc. I love to develop and put in my creativity in building quality applications.</p>
      <p>I love meeting new people, and I easily mingle with a crowd and I'm known to be cheerful and enthusiastic in my friends circle. In my personal time I like to visit new places, dance, and do creative activities like painting.</p>
